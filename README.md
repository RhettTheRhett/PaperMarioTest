# Super Paper Mario 2D-3D Flip Mechanic

A 2D platformer prototype inspired by Super Paper Mario, featuring a **dimension-flip mechanic** that transitions the game between 2D and 3D perspectives.

## Overview

This demo showcases a **dimension-flip mechanic**, allowing the player to switch between a classic 2D platformer view and a 3D perspective. Flipping changes how the player navigates the level, creating new paths, puzzles, and ways to interact with the environment.
